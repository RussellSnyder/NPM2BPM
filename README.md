## Objective

Create a Node based app that plays algorithmically generated music while npm packages load, based on which package you are loading and how fast your connection is

## Technology Planned

100% Javascript all the time.
As much Node as possible because it is awesome.

___!!!ADD YOUR SUGGESTED TECHNOLOGY HERE!!!___

## Milestones

1. Simple app that either beeps when package is downloading or plays a single tone.  Must stop when package download complete
2. Adjust beeps and tone to be spaced based on speed of download.  
3. Have multiple streams of beeps and tones running simultaneously.  
4. Create several melodies based on the name of package and various aethestics (rock, jazz, smooth). 
5. Create tiny UI to choose which melodies a user would like to play during download
6. Integrate into NPM environment so that packages can call NPM2BPM as a dependency melodies will be generated on download 
7. Create electron app ready for testing
8. Run user tests and refactor app according to feedback
9. Release prototype on NPM 
10. Drink the best Whiskey available at Towers Pub in Ludwigsburg

## TODOs

*Decide on which technologies we will use exactly
*Meet and hack together Milestone 1.
